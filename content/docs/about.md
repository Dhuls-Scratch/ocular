## what is ocular?
ocular is a tool for searching the [scratch forums](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/). it contains some cool features like statuses, reactions and starring to make using the scratch forums more fun!

## what is/was my-ocular?
my-ocular previously was a site where you could set your ocular status. for technical reasons this had to be maintained separately from ocular, however in april 2021, all of my-ocular's features were migrated to ocular. my-ocular only remains as a backend/api.

## what is an ocular status?
an ocular status is a short message and favourite colour, which is displayed across ocular and [other sites](/docs/gallery). an ocular status is not required to use ocular, but they allow you to customize your profile a little bit. :)
